create a backend for marks management for school 
once user is login , student list will appear with filters(name,subject) and add/edit/view/delete.

while adding a student with a student and subject combination that already exists in the database 
then include the marks in existing marks. otherwise create a new record.

student data will appear separately  as per the logged-in user.
